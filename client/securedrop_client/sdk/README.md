# SecureDrop SDK

This SDK provides a Pythonic interface to the [SecureDrop Journalist Interface
API](https://developers.securedrop.org/en/latest/journalist_api.html).

* It SHOULD provide types and methods for all resources and endpoints provided
  by the v1 API downstream.  (Any downstream breaking changes MUST be coordinated.)

* It MAY make breaking changes upstream to the SecureDrop Client, as its only
  consumer.
